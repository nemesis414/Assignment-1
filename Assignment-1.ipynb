    "\n",
    "Mutable Data Types:\n",
    "- Lists: Lists are mutable, which means that their elements can be modified after they are created. For example, we can append new elements to a list, remove elements from a list, or change the value of an existing element. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)  # add new element to the end of the list\n",

    "- Dictionaries: Dictionaries are another mutable data type in Python. We can add, modify, or delete key-value pairs in a dictionary after it is created. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 3}\n",
    "my_dict['banana'] = 4  # change the value of the 'banana' key\n",
    "my_dict['orange'] = 5  # add a new key-value pair to the dictionary\n",
    "del my_dict['cherry']  # remove the 'cherry' key-value pair from the dictionary\n",
    "print(my_dict)         # output: {'apple': 1, 'banana': 4, 'orange': 5}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Data Types:\n",
    "- Strings: Strings are immutable in Python, which means that we cannot modify their contents after they are created. For example, we cannot change a single character in a string or add a new character to an existing string. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_string = 'Hello, World!'\n",

    "print(my_string)       # output: 'Hello, World! How are you?'\n",
    "```\n",

    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "my_tuple[1] = 4    # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
